This project is a smart parking system developed for an academic IoT course.
 It simulates a real-time parking availability management system using emulated sensors, such as spot detectors and buttons, communicating over MQTT protocol.
The system includes three main components: a data manager that collects and processes sensor data, a local database that stores the parking status history, and a graphical user interface that displays the current status of all parking spots in a user-friendly way. 
Alerts are generated when a parking spot remains occupied for too long, helping enforce rules or optimize usage. 
The system is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing easy extension to real-world urban environments.
