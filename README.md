This project simulates an IoT-based Smart Parking System. It includes emulators for different sensor types (temperature/humidity, button, and relay), a monitor GUI application to display parking spot statuses and messages in real time, and a local SQLite database to store parking activity. Communication between components is handled using the MQTT protocol. The system is developed in Python using PyQt5 and is intended for academic and demonstration purposes.
